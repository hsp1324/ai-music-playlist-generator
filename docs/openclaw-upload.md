# OpenClaw Upload Workflow

Use this when OpenClaw has generated an audio file and needs to hand it to the AI Music web app.

Run these commands on the Oracle VM from the repo root:

```bash
cd /opt/ai-music-playlist-generator
```

Do not use the public `https://ai-music...sslip.io` URL from OpenClaw. Public traffic is protected by Google login. Use the local API through the helper script instead.

## Upload A New Single Candidate Set

Use this when Suno/OpenClaw produced one or two candidates for the same single release. Suno usually returns two songs; upload both to the same new Single Release so a human can choose one.

```bash
scripts/openclaw-release upload-single-candidates \
  --release-title "Song Title" \
  --audio /absolute/path/to/song-a.mp3 \
  --audio /absolute/path/to/song-b.mp3 \
  --prompt "Short generation prompt or notes" \
  --tags "ai music, single"
```

The command returns JSON with:

- `release.id`
- `release.title`
- `tracks[].id`
- next action

After this, both candidates appear in the web/Slack review queue. A human should approve exactly one candidate to continue the release. If both candidates are rejected, the Single Release is automatically archived instead of deleted. It can be restored from the web UI archive.

## Upload One New Single Candidate

Use this for one generated song that should become its own single release candidate.

```bash
scripts/openclaw-release upload-audio \
  --new-single \
  --audio /absolute/path/to/song.mp3 \
  --title "Song Title" \
  --prompt "Short generation prompt or notes" \
  --tags "ai music, single"
```

The command returns JSON with:

- `release.id`
- `release.title`
- `track.id`
- next action

After this, the track appears in the web/Slack review queue. A human should approve it before render.

## Upload To Existing Release

First list release ids:

```bash
scripts/openclaw-release list-releases
```

Then upload audio to a chosen release:

```bash
scripts/openclaw-release upload-audio \
  --release-id RELEASE_ID \
  --audio /absolute/path/to/song.mp3 \
  --title "Song Title" \
  --prompt "Short generation prompt or notes" \
  --tags "playlist candidate"
```

Use existing playlist releases for multi-song playlist releases. A Single Release may hold up to two review candidates, but only one can be approved and selected for the final single.

## Upload Cover Image

Only do this after release audio is ready. Playlist releases should show `Rendered Mix`; Single Releases use the approved source audio directly.

```bash
scripts/openclaw-release upload-cover \
  --release-id RELEASE_ID \
  --cover /absolute/path/to/cover.png
```

Supported cover formats:

- `jpg`
- `jpeg`
- `png`
- `webp`

Preferred cover size is 16:9, for example `1280x720` or `1920x1080`.

After upload, the release moves to `cover_review`. A human should approve the cover in the web UI, then render video.

## Suggested OpenClaw Instruction

Give OpenClaw this instruction when it finishes a song:

```text
When the final audio file is ready, upload it to the local AI Music app from /opt/ai-music-playlist-generator.
When Suno returns two candidate songs for one single release, run:

scripts/openclaw-release upload-single-candidates --release-title "TITLE" --audio ABSOLUTE_AUDIO_PATH_A --audio ABSOLUTE_AUDIO_PATH_B --prompt "PROMPT" --tags "TAGS"

Return the JSON result, especially release.id and tracks[].id.
Do not approve, render, or publish unless explicitly asked.
If only one candidate exists, run:

scripts/openclaw-release upload-audio --new-single --audio ABSOLUTE_AUDIO_PATH --title "TITLE" --prompt "PROMPT" --tags "TAGS"

Return the JSON result, especially release.id and track.id.
Do not approve, render, or publish unless explicitly asked.
If a 16:9 cover image is also ready and the release already has rendered audio, run:

scripts/openclaw-release upload-cover --release-id RELEASE_ID --cover ABSOLUTE_COVER_PATH
```

## Safety Rules

- Do not call `Approve Publish` automatically.
- Do not upload to YouTube automatically.
- For Suno two-output generations, upload both candidates to one Single Release using `upload-single-candidates`.
- Do not approve both candidates in a Single Release. The human should approve one or reject both.
- If both candidates are rejected, the app will archive the release automatically; do not delete files or database rows manually.
- If three or more songs are ready for one release, use a Playlist Release instead.
